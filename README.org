#+TITLE: IRC Total Information Awareness

The "irctia" module keeps track of the populace of IRC channels.  It maintains a database of

 - joins
 - parts
 - quits
 - kicks
 - bans
 - nick changes.

It lets you answer questions like:

 - "In order, what are the nicks a given nick has used since joining?"
 - "For a given nick, user or host, what nick user and host has been used in the past?"
 - "What bans was placed on a given nick, user or host and how long did they last?"
